# Dog Documentation

## Overview

I wrote it to learn Rust, but also because it might be useful.

The primary target audience of the Dog language are data engineers, who need to move and manipulate data from different
data sources and then place the results in a different location.

Eventually, I'd like to see the language grow to support data scientists and also to be useful in operational tasks.
