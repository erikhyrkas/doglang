Thank you so much for taking the time to contribute!

I'm new to managing an open source project, so bear with me as we iron out the wrinkles. I looked at a few examples from other projects and will attempt to create a useful guide.

* [Communication](#communication)


# Code of Conduct

Don't be a jerk. We can come up with a more detailed list of ways of being respectful, helpful, and nice, but I think that if you start off with being respectful and assuming good intent from others, we'll be fine.

# How much experienced do I need?

If you want to help and are willing to learn, we'll find a way to let you be helpful. Even if you've never written a line of code, there's a place you can start and contribute if you are interested in learning.

We need help with every aspect of making a project successful, from design, to code, to documentation, to art, advocates and marketing, you name it!

Before you join, take the time to read through all of the documentation we have today. This will help you understand the state of the project and won't take that long. Before you are done, you'll have questions and that will help us figure out how to improve right from your first minute of contributing.

# Communication

From design decisions, suggestions, and planning, we'll start out by trying to use the Discussions feature of Github.

# Pull Requests

Yeah, some of the initial code is minimally tested, but as we progress, I expect that coverage to grow. We'll work on a style guide (did I mention that we need help?) and more details of what
a good pull request looks like. I'm pretty sure none of the original commits will qualify as good, but that's where we started.
